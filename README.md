- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some indie game ideas
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity and Blender
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on 2D/3D artist, fellow indie dev and VFX/SFX people.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with artwork, sprite sheet, 3D models.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Facebook/Twitter/Gmail/Github
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a dad and don't have much time playing games. But I spend my precious free time making crappy game prototype.
